## What is Terraform? 
-  There are 2 sides of IAC:
	- Configurement management 
	- Orchesration 

__```Ansible```__ - configuration management 
__```Terraform```__ - orchestration 
__```Kubernetes```__ - orchhestration is used in containerisation - i.e Docker, 
__```Crio```__ - Rocket 

## Terraform 
1. Orchestration tools to configure out instances and their AWS configurations remotely.
2. Terraform files are created with .`tf` extension 
3. Set Environment variables, via `Environmental variables` and add the `ACCESS` and `SECRET` Keys as user variables. Terraform will automatically pick them up.
4. Make sure you refresh any current instances of `Git Bash` you have running as the environmental variables will not take effect until you have done that. Find the commands to create 
the instance [below](#Terraform-Commands).

## Terraform commands:
	- ```terraform init```
	- ```terraform plan``` - checks the steps inside the code and lists success or erros
	- ```terraform apply``` - will implement the code - deploy the infrastructure
